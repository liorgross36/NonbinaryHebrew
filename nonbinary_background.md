Though often excluded from Western mainstream discourse, there are many people currently as well as [throughout history](http://bilerico.lgbtqnation.com/2008/02/transgender_history_trans_expression_in.php) whose gender does not fit in the binary system of “man” and “woman”.

These people are commonly referred to as [nonbinary](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/9-things-people-get-wrong-about-being-non-binary) (with nonbinary as an adjective). 

I feel that for the average reader of this paper, a brief exploration of terms, definitions, and gender theory is necessary in order to address the rest of the discussion in a concise and accessible manner.

For more information, please consult the amazing resource ["Our Trans Loved Ones"](https://www.pflag.org/sites/default/files/Our%20Trans%20Loved%20Ones.pdf) from PFLAG, and [this article](https://www.vox.com/2015/4/24/8483561/transgender-gender-identity-expression) from Vox.

## Assigned gender
refers to the coercive designation of a gender to a person’s visible anatomy that occurs at birth.

### Intersex people
do not fit the constructed biological sex binary, due to their hormone levels, their bodies’ methods of processing and responding to hormones, their chromosomes, and/or their external and internal anatomy.
They may or may not be coercively assigned a gender at birth.

## Gender identity
refers to one’s internal sense of self in terms of gender.

## Gender expression
is how one’s appearance and performance in society is gendered, and can be manifested in clothing, speech, mannerisms, and gendered activities.

## Transgender
an adjective for the gender identity of a person whose body is coercively gendered in a manner that is not consistent with their understood truth of their gender identity.

## Cisgender
an adjective for the gender identity of a person whose body is coercively gendered in a manner is that is consistent with their understood truth of their gender identity.

### Transsexual
often still used and equated to “transgender” but is considered by many transgender folks to be offensive and outdated.

However, some transgender folks and gender theorists use “transsexual” to distinguish between people who physically alter their body in order to make it more congruent with their gender identity.

In this sense, “transgender” then can mean someone who alters their gender expression in order to make the external gendering of not only their body but also their presence and performance in society more congruent with their sense of self.

# Historical context

In Western society, there are many reinforced binaries, used to keep systems in power, for example those that were imposed during the Victorian era of empiricism.
One of these binaries is that of gender. Though many cultures for thousands of years have acknowledged more than two genders, this recent imposition of a binary system of gender is the norm in our society today.

Along with this binary view of gender comes an expectation for conformity to certain behaviors, self-expressions, and appearances.

As such, people with identities that transgress this view of gender are violating a norm that protects systems of power and therefore are subject to violence, whether directly from those systems of power or from people reinforcing the norms of society that keep them comfortable.
