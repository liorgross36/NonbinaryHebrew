They have been written up in a variety of forums, which can be read below.

## SVARA
http://www.svara.org/

This is an amazing community led by many of the trans rabbis mentioned above, who host Queer Talmud Camp each year in order to empower those with queer svara with the gemarna to change halakha for a more radical and inclusive Jewish community. 

## *Transparent*
The TV show *Transparent* has radically changed the way that pop culture engages with Judaism, trans folks, and family, as well as the visibility of trans Jewish identity and what it means.
