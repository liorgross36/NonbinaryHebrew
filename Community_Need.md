## Movement in the Movements
### Conservative
On April 6th, 2016, the Rabbinical Assembly of Conservative Judaism instructed “all programs affiliated with the Conservative Movement” to fully welcome trans members of the community into all practices and to respect their pronouns and identities. The resolution cited b’tzelem Elohim, kvod habriyot (human dignity), the higher risks that trans people face, and the increasing government acknowledgement and protection for trans folks. Furthermore, it highlights the history of trans identities in Jewish tradition: “the literature of halakhah, from the Mishnah to contemporary responsa, affirms the variety of non-binary gender expression throughout history, granting transgender people the obligations and privileges of all Jews”.

### Reform
The Reform Movement of Judaism adopted a similar resolution in 2015 and went a step beyond that of the Conservative Movement by calling on the US and Canadian governments to provide greater protection for trans people.

### Reconstructionist
Also, on March 29th, 2017, the Reconstructionist Movement of Judaism adopted a resolution with almost identical language to the resolution from the Conservative Movement, though the expected outcomes are much more structured and directed than those of the Rabbinical Assembly and encourage direct action steps to help transgender community members.

## Including community members
In order for nonbinary community members to be fully embraced in Jewish ritual cycles, we must have a way to honor them in Hebrew. This dilemma was featured in a [Tablet Magazine article](www.tabletmag.com/scroll/240492/come-to-the-bimah-and-read-from-the-torah-but-first-whats-your-preferred-gender-pronoun) last year. JTA [recently wrote](www.jta.org/2018/03/01/life-religion/teen-gender-neutral-bnei-mitzvah) about one example, a nonbinary teen’s B’nai Mitzvah. These articles signal not only the increased occurrence of milestone celebrations in Jewish community for nonbinary congregants but also widespread interest on the topic of these ceremonies from the larger American Jewish community. Furthermore, both TransTorah.org and Noach Dzumra’s *Balancing on the Mechitza* outline prayer and ritual to mark special moments of transition; however, these resources are limited by their binary nature.
## Feminist applications
Finally, a third, neutral category could be used in order to talk about people whose gender is unknown as well as to speak inclusively about large groups of people. By using this gender-expansive option instead of masculine as a default, anyone could find that a message applies to them specifically, from medical terminology to advertising. With the pursuit for gender equity comes a move away from traditional roles as well, and using this system to allow any noun to be gendered to be inclusive opens possibilities for people ideologically as well as potentially incurring institutional shifts.
