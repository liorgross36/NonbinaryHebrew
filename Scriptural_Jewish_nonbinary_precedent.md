# Jewish Precedents for Non-binary Manifestations

## Talmudic Gender Categories
The rabbis of the Mishna, during the first through second centuries CE, recognized several categories for gender :
- “zakhar” (male)
- “nekevah” (female)
- “tumtum” (indistinguishable whether male or female or neither male nor female)
- “androgynos” (both male and female)
- “saris” (born male but later develops female traits, or castrated )
- “aylonit” (born female, but later develops male traits, or cannot get pregnant)

[Rabbi Elliot Kukla](http://forward.com/news/180226/for-elliot-kukla-gender-transition-and-ordination/), who has done extensive research, text study, and writings on gender diversity in Judaism, has found that:
> “All these genders appear frequently in classical Jewish texts… The tumtum appears 17 times in the Mishnah; 23 times in the Tosefta; 119 times in the Babylonian Talmud; 22 times in the Jerusalem Talmud and hundreds of times in Midrash, commentaries, and halacha. The androgynos appears 21 times in the Mishnah; 19 times in the Tosefta 109 times in the Babylonian Talmud and countless times in midrash and halacha.” (["A Created Being of Its Own"](http://www.transtorah.org/PDFs/How_I_Met_the_Tumtum.pdf))

These various terms are not only mentioned in order to discuss laws and their pertinence to intersex and gender-expansive Jews in the times of the Talmud, they are also applied to passages from the Torah.

## Biblical Figures

### Avram and Sarai

For example, it is understood in the Babylonian Talmud, Yevamot 64a, that Avram and Sarai were tumtumim and when God changes their names and bestows them with the covenant and the commandment to lech l’cha, he also makes them a man and a woman, respectively.

### Adam and Eve

In addition, there are many writings from the Sages as well as modern rabbis about the genders of Adam and Eve. Some texts understand them to be androgynos, while others take a more metaphorical look at Eve as a counterpart, though not opposite, for Adam.

In addition, they dissect they text about Eve as a being derived from Adam’s rib and therefore a manifestation of how all men have femininity within them.

In Midrash Bereshit Rabbah 8:1, the rib that Eve is created from is compared to a door of the Mishkan, an extraordinarily holy object because it is the constructed home for the divine presence.

As such, the dual nature or androgynos form of Adam can be seen as holy as a result of this textual language, as it is written:
> “Rabbi Tanchuma in the name of Rabbi Benayah and Rabbi Berechya in the name of Rabbi Elazar said: “At the time that the Holy One, blessed be the One, created the first adam, [He] created him as a golem [an unformed physical substance]; and it was extended from one end of the world to its other end, as there it is written: “My golem Your eyes have seen…” (Psalm 139:16)”.

In addition, also in this Midrash, Rabbi Jeremiah ben Elazar says, “When the Holy One, blessed be the One, created the first adam, [God] created him [an] “androgynos.” As there it is written [Genesis 5:2]: ‘When God created the adam, He made him in the likeness of God; male and female [God] created them.’”

A modern scholar, Susan Weidman Schneider, interprets this verse as a merism, such as “thick and thin” or “young and old”. As such “male and female [God] created them” can be read as "Zachar u'nkevah bara otam." "God created male and female and every combination in between." (["Transgender Jews: An Introduction"](https://www.lilith.org/articles/transgender-jews/))


From this passage of Torah also comes the text “in the likeness of God”, btzelem Elohim, which is often used to invoke human holiness, power, morality, and responsibility.

In the Mishna, Pirkei Avot, 3:14, it says, “Rabbi Akiva would say, “Beloved is humanity for we were made in the image of God. And doubly beloved are we for God made it known to us that we are made in His image.”

I read this text to mean that if something is made explicitly known in the Torah, it is endowed with another degree of holiness.

As such, the ambiguity of gender given to the adam and the nuance given to humanity in the very first chapter of the Torah conveys to me that all forms of human life are created in God’s image and as such we are all intrinsically and extraordinarily holy.

Other rabbis in this Midrash see the adam in the creation story as a golem, ready to be shaped to God’s will and holy in its state of proto-creation:
> “Rabbi Tanchuma in the name of Rabbi Benayah and Rabbi Berechya in the name of Rabbi Elazar said: “At the time that the Holy One, blessed be the One, created the first adam, [He] created him as a golem [an unformed physical substance]; and it was extended from one end of the world to its other end, as there it is written: “My golem Your eyes have seen…” (Psalm 139:16)”.

As such, the androgynos form is written and discussed in Midrash to be in the image of God and therefore as natural, holy, and valid as a conventionally understood male or female form.

## Bria bi'fney atzmah

Furthermore, in Mishnah Bikkurim 4:5, the androgynos is discussed as a holy subversion of binary thinking because of the phrase “Bri’a bi’fnei atzmah”, “a being created of its own”.
This phrase is also used to refer to the koi in Tosefta Bikkurim 2 because the koi is neither wild nor domesticated. (["A Created Being of Its Own"](http://www.transtorah.org/PDFs/How_I_Met_the_Tumtum.pdf))
