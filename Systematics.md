title: Grammar & Systematics

We followed some of the precedents set, as illustrated in the articles above, and then extrapolated these conventions in order to apply to adjective- gendering, declension, and verb conjugation.

The chart below illustrates some examples of our systematics. We used ִימוֹת– and other combined endings, as well as אָתֶמֵן, but found that וֹל– imposed difficulties in flow of speech as well as verb conjugation, opting for the “e” system in a stroke of convergent evolution to nonbinary Spanish speakers.

Also, in cases in which the feminine and masculine were the same, we did not provide a third option, opting instead to follow convention for terms that are already gender-inclusive. Below, s stands for singular, pl for plural, and the numbers are to indicate second or third person.

## Anticipated issues
Though we found tremendous success in the implementation of these systematics, the application in the classroom is only the beginning. Our exploration of these conventions was limited to the scope of the class, the introductory nature of which did not cover all tenses or verb forms that are commonly used in Hebrew. In addition, the lack of vowels in writing Hebrew may make it difficult to distinguish the feminine form from the gender-expansive form in publication for singular nouns as well as some verbs. Furthermore, convention standardization for exceptions would be necessary for smooth comprehension and widespread implementation, for we can share the tool of the  “e” but for exceptions highlighted in the chart, the convention could be molded to fit the speaker instead of being used in an established manner. Finally, some of the forms, such as in past tense, may require trained ears to hear the vocalized differences in emphasis and accent, which could be a challenge for comprehension as well.
